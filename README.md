# Music Streaming Application

Under this project, I have created this ETL pipeline for a hypothetical startup called Sparkify. Sparkify wants to analyze the data which they have collected on songs and user activity for thier new music streaming service. All of this data sits in a directory of JSON logs of user activity, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

My role in this project as a Data Engineer is to create a Postgres database with the tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. I also have created the database schemas and the ETL pipeline for the analysis. 

## Project Description

Creating an ETL pipeline using Python. The pipeline transfers data from files in two local local directories into the tables in Postgres using Python and SQL. This project also includes defining the fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particulcar analytic focus.
